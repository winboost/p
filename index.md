## Why bother?

### Well, it's not always a matter of choice.

As Elon Musk aptly puts it, you're already a cyborg whether you like it or not. Our gadgets, like phones and PC's, have become 'extensions' of our body in that they are now pretty much necessary for any human to go about his / her day, as far as the developed part of the world is concerned.<br>
Unfortunately, the software that runs the physical gadgets is not always the part that would make your life easier. At least not right off the bat. Fortunately, it can be adjusted.<br>
However, companies like Microsoft are notorious for going to great lengths to make any such adjustments as difficult as possible. And although you might say there are other alternatives out there, you may very well find out that, depending on the given purpose or task at hand, Windows will likely still be the most reasonable choice for many practical reasons.<br>
Yes, Linux is free and may seem alluring to those who are tech-savvy by nature but it's an incredible mess that only proves that taking a hundred directions simultaneously is not always the best way to get anywhere. I have yet to see a distro that works without a vast amount of significant issues. I understand that it can be a nice hobby for those who like solving problems and don't mind spending a s**tload of time doing so. But it's not exactly the best vehicle for an average Joe who just needs to go from A to B as efficiently as possible and without much fuss.<br>
macOS is a different story and by all means go down that route if you can be your own boss and use it for everything you need. I bet that Apple will get a lot of traction in the near future as more and more people will learn about the benefits of their new Silicon chips.<br>
And as much as I would like to see something fresh in the realm of operating systems, (I'm curious about projects like Google's Fuchsia, for example), many of us will still need to deal with Windows because of the entire ecosystem we're stuck in, compatibility reasons or simply because we're already kind of addicted to it…<br>
And if you fit into this category, it's really not about whether you want to tweak it or not. It's just about when you will need to. And I can tell you that you probably will right at the start…<br>
So, let's break it down and get rid of all the garbage and the common problems with Windows.<br>
You're in the right place. This website is essentially nothing but the notes I've made for myself over the years so they're readily accessible whenever I need to make a certain tweak or so.<br>
The navigation on the left-hand side is sorted to follow a step-by-step logic but feel free to jump around if you're only seeking a particular piece of information.
