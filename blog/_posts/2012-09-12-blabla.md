Some content 1 The default configuration has the page archive,<!--more--> where all the posts are listed grouped by year and month of the post date. Currently the months appear in English. I've looked at the code and this is an excerpt which is responsible for putting the date. Because i18n is not available on github pages, I built upon answer of @Kleo Petroff and the answer of @Falc, I set up a way to have a date with locale names defined in a YAML file Note that page.date | date: "%-m" output the month number as a string, ie June number is actually "6" not 6, liquid silently casts that string to a number when piping the minus filter.
During development it was not something I was aware and thus liquid didn't returned anything when passingmwith the value "6" tosite.data.fr.months[m]`, I only saw the trick when looking at Falc answer.
