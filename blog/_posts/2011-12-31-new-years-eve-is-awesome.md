Personal licenses are a once off purchase, and come with 3 years of updates. After 3 years, an upgrade will be required to receive further updates. One license key is all you need for all your computers and operating systems. License Keys are issued by Sublime HQ Pty Ltd, ABN 48 153 193 661, and covered by the End User License Agreement. Sublime HQ Pty Ltd is located in Sydney, Australia. Most designs go with the available defaults. Either using a format that doesn’t have these issues or, more frequently, letting the details slip.
